# Object Tracking with 2 Servo and ESP 32 CAM
I made a project where the camera (ESP32 cam) will follow the movement of an object using the help of 2 pan (Horizontal) and tilt (Vertical) servos. For example, when the object moves to the left, the camera will move to the left. For more information, you can watch my video :
